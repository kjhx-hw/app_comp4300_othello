# Othello

## About

Othello, originally called Reversi, is an abstract strategy board game invented during the Victorian era. It has remained popular for more than a century being given a boost in the 1970s when a version of it was re-marketed under the name 'Othello' and another in the 1990s when a computer version of it was included with the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Othello involves play by two parties on an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. Pieces typically appear coin-like, with a light and a dark face, each side representing one player. The goal for each player is to make pieces of their color constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.

## Instructions

The first four moves are always within the center four squares of the board. In this game, those moves have already been made prior to the game starting.

Each piece played must be laid adjacent to an opponent's piece so that the opponent's piece or a row of opponent's pieces is flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's color. All of the opponent's pieces between these two pieces are 'captured' and turned over to match the player's color.

It can happen that a piece is played so that pieces or rows of pieces in more than one direction are trapped between the new piece played and other pieces of the same color. In this case, all the pieces in all viable directions are turned over.

The game is over when neither player has a legal move (i.e. a move that captures at least one opposing piece) or when the board is full.
