# app_comp4300_spades
## About
Spades is a four player card game where you attempt to win points by playing a card of the greatest value and betting how many points you will win. This implementation pairs a single person (and a computer teammate) against two computer controlled players.

This project was written for COMP 4300 at Harding University. It was bootstrapped with [electron-quick-start-typescript][].
